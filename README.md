# A Kishore Dev

This is my Projects repository where I am adding stuff which I really enjoy doing. 

There are sub-projects which can be found in this repository.

#pollutionapi--

In this I am using API data from the data.gov.in site and using it to reflect the pollution data for Air Quality across the country.

#reactmodules--
It is one of the react projects created and it is a web version of a Phonebook where we can add names and then search from the added list. It uses React & Context API as state management.
